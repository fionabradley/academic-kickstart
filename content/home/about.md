I help people to use and create information, and advocate so that everyone can do the same. My experience has included strategic roles with global impact on the library and information profession, national influence, and lasting outcomes for library organisations and individuals. My work has spanned academic library management, policy and advocacy, extensive focus on building the capacity of the library profession, major grants, and research and analysis of major global and sectoral issues. My research interests in international relations include human rights, access to information, and technology.
