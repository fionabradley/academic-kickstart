Today is Ada Lovelace Day, a day to celebrate women in computing. Hooray! Read more about great women in computing at [ACM-W](http://women.acm.org/).

One of the things I love about librarianship is that there are so many opportunities to do amazing things with computers, from social networking, to blogging, to sysadmin’ing, to programming. And I’ve been inspired by so many others, irrespective of gender. Some people who inspire me right now are on the list at [Shovers and Makers](http://www.shoversandmakers.net/) doing wonderful things every day.

I’ve been the only girl in the university computer club, and I’ve built computers out of spare parts, and typed up programs from the back of magazines in the 80s, but ‘computing’ never seemed like an actual career option at the time. So I’m glad that librarianship has so many ways to explore your interest, no matter whether that’s putting on exhibitions, helping people at the refdesk, or writing about data. And a lot of that has to do with the inspirational people who have led the way in defining what this profession is about.
