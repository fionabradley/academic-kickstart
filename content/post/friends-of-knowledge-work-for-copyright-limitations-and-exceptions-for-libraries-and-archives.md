> Mr. Chairman, we welcome the presentation by the distinguished delegates of Brazil on the treaty on limitation for Libraries and Archives as well as the modified proposals of IFLA and other like-minded organizations and for want of a better expression, Mr. Chairman, permit me to just refer to them as **friends of knowledge.**

There’s been a lot of discussion over recent years in our profession about what we can do to change copyright. The good news is, libraries are working to do this right now at WIPO’s 23rd meeting of the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR23), taking place in Geneva until December 2\. If you have any interest in this topic, and if you’re a librarian, I’ll take that as a yes, you can follow the [events and background issues online on IFLA’s website](http://www.ifla.org/en/copyright-tlib) and even read the [simultaneous text feed of the discussions](http://www.streamtext.net/player?event=WIPO) (password: wipo4me).

The Nigerian delegation coined a wonderful new term today: friends of knowledge. Expect to see a lot more of it in the coming days.
