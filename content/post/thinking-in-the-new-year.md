Another year, and another round of resolutions. Last year, I traveled 150,000 km and was on the road more than 100 days. And the year before, and the year before that. In November, I moved to the Hague for a new job and am looking forward to having more time for all kinds of projects, and inevitably, started the year with a resolution to update this blog more often.

This year, I’m interested in exploring the future: what impact will [demographic change](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138474/fareed-zakaria/can-america-be-fixed) have on libraries 20, 50 years from now? What role will we play as stewards and [curators](http://literateowl.com/2013/01/01/mission-creep-libraries-and-3d-printers-what/) in a post-collection world? How can we continue to encourage cooperation and cohesion across our profession?

Over the past few years, I’ve worked with librarians in many countries on organisational change and sustainability, to demonstrate the difference libraries make in a changing world. I’ve had the fortune to sit in on some [great pub conversations](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/55131-you-have-two-maybe-three-years.html), [travel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/blisspix/sets/72157624958528896/) to many libraries (see above), and strategize about the future. Few of those reflections have made it to the blog, so this year I aim to change that. More soon.
