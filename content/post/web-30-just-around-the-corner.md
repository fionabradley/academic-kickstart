Several blogs have posted about Web 3.0 recently, most trying to come up with a central set of ideas about what it might be. For some, Web 3.0 = Semantic Web, for others, Semantic Web is just a part of it. My take on it that I wrote in October last year, if there is such a thing as Web 3.0, can be found on the [About page of this blog](/about/):

> *   Semantic web: True write once, publish many: hamstrung until now by proprietary software, proliferation of XML schemas, and a lack of end-user tools.
> *   Metadata: Meaning and context within and between objects, new languages.
> *   Rich open data: Geotagging, eScience data for everyone
> *   Content anywhere, especially mobile
> *   Make your own software: bringing software and tool creation to the masses
> *   Two opposing ends: on demand anywhere (video, TV, radio, text), lightweight flexible architecture
>
> Politics and governance issues will continue to evolve to bring;
>
> *   Ubiquitous Open Access
> *   Access to Knowledge (A2K) in the developing world

I think it is important to keep in mind the political and governance issues surrounding the web. The technical part of Web 3.0 is not possible without supportive research, funding, and policies. Additionally, if Web 3.0 impacts people’s lives by making communication and managing information easier, it has to include all kinds of knowledge (social, government, entertainment, scholarly) and be accessible by people all over the world regardless of language, socioeconomic and geographical barriers.

While I enjoyed all the good things the supposed Web 2.0 movement offered - community, interaction, etc - I am hoping that Web 3.0 will pay attention to the difficult issues around data, scholarly communication, and dissemination of research. Linked data is an area of research on this topic, but I hope to see more standards, policies and funding in this area.

A study of all the different ideas people have about Web 3.0 [was posted by Jonas Bolinder](http://impl.emented.com/2008/04/20/web-30-the-semantic-implicit-mobile-or-distributed-web/), and fell into four categories -

*   Semantic Web
*   APIs and Web Services
*   Mobile Web and other devices
*   Implicit Web (personalisation and recommendation)

There’s a little bit of each of these in my view of Web 3.0

A post on [Read/Write Web](http://www.readwriteweb.com/), [Web 3.0 Through the Ages](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/web_30_through_the_ages.php), sums up some of the current thinking around the term, valid or not and concludes -

> “…the discussions we have about defining the next web help to solidify our vision of where we’re going — and you can’t get there until you decide where you want to go. “

I agree, and I’m interested to see where the discussions lead next.
